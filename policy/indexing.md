# Indexing/de-indexing mods from CKAN

Our policy is based on two principles:

* CKAN takes licenses very seriously
* CKAN acts in the interests of its users AND mod authors

Note that for purposes of this document, the term "author" does not necessarily mean the original author of a mod.  It should be understood to include a maintainer, custodian, etc.

CKAN will not index a mod without the author's permission.  The CKAN team recognizes that indexing a mod on CKAN can be a burden on authors - at the very least, they need to make decisions about the metadata and it is one more thing they are responsible for supporting.  Indexing a mod on CKAN also benefits the author: it can make installation easier, reducing support requests; it can enforce depdendencies and conflicts automatically; it provides an easy way for users to update the mod; and it can increase a mod's visibility.  Minimizing the burden and maximizing the benefits to mod authors is a core goal of the CKAN team.

A collaborative environment is crucial.  When something goes wrong - and it will - sometimes the mod author is at fault and sometimes it's the CKAN metadata or a bug in CKAN itself.  Recognizing this and working together to resolve issues yields the greatest benefit to CKAN users.  The CKAN team will always strive to support mod authors in fixing these issues.  The CKAN team can be reached on discord (use Help->Discord in the CKAN client) or you can file an issue on https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN (if you suspect the issue is related to the client) or https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/NetKAN (if you suspect the issue is related to metadata).  Pull requests are always welcome.

When a mod has a permissive license (GPL, MIT, CC, etc), someone else may adopt or fork the mod and request that their version be indexed on CKAN.  This ensures that abandoned mods can be continued and support requests go to the new author instead of the original one.  The new author may choose to create a new identifier or replace an existing one.  The CKAN team recommends using all possible avenues to contact the original author (github, forum DM, email, etc) and waiting a reasonable amount of time for a response before adopting a mod.  The CKAN team may consider input from the previous author or other factors before indexing the adopted mod.  Mods that have restrictive licenses require proof of permission to adopt the mod from the original author before they will be indexed on CKAN.

When someone requests a mod for indexing, the CKAN team will attempt to verify that the person making the request is the author of the mod and that they comply with any licenses on the mod's content.  Obviously this cannot be perfect.  If you believe your content is indexed on CKAN and is in violation of its license, please alert the CKAN team.  Note that CKAN does not host or distribute any mod content - it only links to mod content on sites like spacedock, github, etc. and provides a method to fetch that content similar to a web browser.

The CKAN team may reject a request to index a mod for any reason.  Primarily the CKAN team will consider the impact on users and other mod authors when making this decision - for example mods that are likely to cause conflicts, data loss, compatibility issues, etc.

If an author asks for their mod to be de-indexed, the CKAN team will do so promptly and without question.
